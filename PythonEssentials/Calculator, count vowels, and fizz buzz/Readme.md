## Unit Tests on Python
---

Hello, here is my homework on Unit Tests. I have created Unit Tests for each of three apps (calculator, count vowels, and fizz buzz). In some apps, I have tried to use unexpected inputs and I have got some errors. After that, I have changed the code a little bit to practice to avoid any type of mistakes during running a code.

Thank you!
