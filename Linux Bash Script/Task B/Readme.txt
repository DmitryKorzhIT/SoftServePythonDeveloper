Hello!

These are my solutions on the B task for bash script studying with SoftServe company.

To use these solutions you have to write in the bash next command:
"Path to solution file" "Path to apache_logs.txt file".

For example:
Input:
./Task_B1_solution.sh ./apache_logs.txt
Output:
62 157.55.39.250
